# Limitations and Future Work

This document outlines current limitations and planned improvements for the Smart Contract Decompilation system.

## Current Limitations

### 1. Training Data Dependency

**Limitation**: Quality depends on diversity and size of training dataset

**Impact**:
- May struggle with rare or novel patterns
- Limited by Solidity versions in training data
- Dependent on quality of verified contracts

**Mitigation**:
- Continuously expand training dataset
- Include contracts from multiple sources
- Balance complexity distribution

### 2. Computational Requirements

**Limitation**: Significant GPU resources needed for training and inference

**Specifications**:
- Training: NVIDIA A100 (40GB) recommended
- Inference: 4-6GB VRAM minimum
- Time: 1-2 seconds per function (GPU)

**Impact**:
- Not suitable for resource-constrained environments
- Higher operational costs than traditional decompilers
- Slower than CPU-based tools

### 3. Complex DeFi Patterns

**Limitation**: Some sophisticated financial mechanisms need improvement

**Challenges**:
- Fixed-point arithmetic precision
- Complex temporal mechanics
- Novel DeFi primitives
- Cross-contract interactions

**Examples**:

### 4. Optimization Patterns

**Limitation**: Highly optimized bytecode can be challenging

**Issues**:
- Inline assembly not always perfectly handled

### 6. Context Window

**Limitation**: Maximum 20,000 tokens per function

**Impact**:
- Very large functions may be truncated
- Some complex contracts exceed limit
- Requires function splitting

**Mitigation**:
- Split large functions
- Process in multiple passes
- Use sliding window approach
